    "### Description \n",
    "As part of my New Year's Resolution of 2020 and in an effort to better remember my life, I began writing a mood journal. Everyday, I would write down a few paragraphs about my day and rank my mood with a number between -3 to +3. It was when I took Introduction to Data Mining that spring semester that I realized I could use a supervised machine learning model on my journal. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Method \n",
    "Before diving into the details and the code, here is a brief overview of my approach. I used a private Instagram account as my mood journal, attaching a photo and caption for each day. I first needed to extract the text from all the data. __I used Instagram's API to extract the data__Once I achieved this, I used the 'bag of words' approach to summarize the textual data. And finally, I used various supervised machine learning classifiers to model and predict my mood. __I also compared this result to a cyclical regression model__ "
